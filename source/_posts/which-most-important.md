# the most important thing in life.
- Keeping healthy. It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.
- Everybody needs somebody, be that a friend, a partner, or someone you’re related to.
- Making someone’s day full of sunshine even when yours is not.
- Money should not be a priority.
- The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take it away from you.
- Know who you are.
- Don’t be a victim BUT instead be a hero in your life.
- Don't give up. A winner is just a loser who tried on more time.
- Always make time for gratitude.
